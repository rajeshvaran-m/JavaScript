# JavaScript

<h4> JavaScript is a High-Level, Object-Oriented, multi-paradigm programming language </h4>

> **High-Level:** We don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management
> **Object-Oriented:** Based on objects for storing most kind of data
> **Multi-paradigm:** We can use different styles of programming

## Values and Variables

- A variable is a box where we can store values, later in the code we can reference the variable over and over again.

- Always use camel case convention for variable
  ```js
  let firstPersonName = "James";
  ```
- Don't use the below naming convention for variable naming
  ```js
  let new = 'NEW';
  let 3years = 3;
  let James = 'James';
  let james&Murphy = 'JM';
  ```
- Allowed naming conventions

  ```js
  let myPreviousJob = "Programmer";
  let myCurrentJob = "Teacher";
  let PI = 3.14;
  ```
